React Login Form Component

🔹 Overview

Demonstrates a simple login form built with React.js using functional components and React Hooks.
Provides a practical understanding of handling user input, managing component state, and form validation in a frontend application.
Implements a clean and responsive UI using inline styles for layout and user feedback.

🔹 Frontend (React.js)

Developed using React functional components, allowing modular and reusable code.
Uses React Hooks to manage state:

useState() for username, password, and error messages.
Handles form submission and input validation using event handlers (onSubmit and onChange).

🔹 Form Handling & Validation

User enters username and password in controlled input fields.
handleSubmit function prevents default form submission behavior using e.preventDefault().

Validates that both fields are filled:

If fields are empty, sets an error message displayed below the inputs.
If fields are valid, clears error and logs credentials to the console.

🔹 User Interface & Styling

Form is centered both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox.
Input fields and buttons have rounded corners, padding, and hover/click feedback for better UX.
Error messages are displayed in red for immediate user feedback.
Card layout includes shadow and border to make the form visually distinct.
Inline styles object used for quick styling without external CSS files.

🔹 Key Concepts Demonstrated

Controlled components for form inputs (value and onChange).
State management with React Hooks (useState).
Form submission handling and validation.
Conditional rendering of error messages.
Inline styling for responsive and modern UI design.

🔹 Conclusion

This component provides a foundational example of building interactive forms in React.
It shows how to manage input, validate data, and provide feedback to the user dynamically.
Serves as a starting point for integrating login functionality with backend authentication systems, like JWT-based APIs.
