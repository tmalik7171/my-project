JWT-Based Authentication in Express.js

🔹 Overview

Demonstrates how to implement user authentication and protected routes in a Node.js backend using Express.js and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Provides a practical understanding of how to generate, verify, and use JWTs to secure API endpoints.
Implements role-independent access control and token-based session management for web applications.

🔹 Backend (Express.js)

Built using Express.js, a minimal and fast Node.js framework.
Handles HTTP methods like GET and POST for login and protected routes.
Defines a POST API endpoint (/login) to authenticate users and generate JWT tokens with payload information (id and username).
Includes a GET API endpoint (/protected) that verifies JWTs and allows access only to authenticated users.
Uses body-parser middleware to parse JSON request bodies and jsonwebtoken for creating and validating tokens.

🔹 Authentication Flow

User sends login credentials via POST /login.
Backend verifies credentials against a hardcoded user.

On success:

Generates a JWT containing user id and username.
Sets expiration to 1 hour.
Decodes the token to include iat (issued at) and exp (expiration) in the response.
On failure, returns a 401 Unauthorized response with an error message.

🔹 Protected Routes

The /protected endpoint demonstrates token verification:
Requires an Authorization header with format Bearer <token>.
Verifies the JWT using the secret key.
Returns a success message if the token is valid.
Returns an error message if the token is missing or invalid.

🔹 Security Considerations

Passwords are hardcoded in this example for simplicity — in real applications, passwords must be hashed and stored securely.
JWTs are used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints.
Token expiration ensures sessions are valid for a limited time, reducing security risks.

🔹 Key Concepts Demonstrated

RESTful API development using Express.js
User authentication using JWT
Token generation (jwt.sign) and verification (jwt.verify)
Handling protected routes and checking authorization headers
Sending structured JSON responses with status codes

🔹 Conclusion

This project provides a hands-on understanding of secure authentication in backend applications.
It shows how to create JWTs, protect API routes, and manage token-based sessions effectively.
Serves as a foundational example for building secure web applications with login systems and protected resources.
