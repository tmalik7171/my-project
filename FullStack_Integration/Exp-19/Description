Connecting React Frontend to Express API Using Axios

🔹 Overview

Demonstrates complete integration between frontend (React.js) and backend (Express.js) components.
Provides a practical understanding of how data flows between client and server in a full-stack web application.
Implements a RESTful architecture with secure communication and dynamic rendering.

🔹 Backend (Express.js)

Built using Express.js, a fast and minimal Node.js framework.
Handles HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Defines a GET API endpoint (/api/products) that returns a static JSON list of products.
Uses CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware to enable safe communication between frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 5000).
Responsible for processing client requests and sending appropriate responses.

🔹 Frontend (React.js)

Developed using React, allowing creation of dynamic and component-based UIs.
Utilizes React Hooks for functionality:
useEffect() - triggers an API call when the component loads.
useState() - stores and manages fetched product data.
Uses Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, to perform asynchronous API requests and handle responses.
Displays loading and error messages gracefully using React’s state management.

🔹 Data Handling & Rendering

The frontend sends a GET request to the Express API and retrieves product data.
Data is displayed dynamically using JSX syntax, combining HTML and JavaScript seamlessly.
Each product card includes:
Product name
Product price
A “Buy Now” button
Implements conditional rendering for user feedback during loading or failure.

🔹 User Interface & Styling

Styled using custom CSS for a modern dark-themed UI.
Each card has hover effects, smooth transitions, and rounded corners for aesthetics.
Uses responsive layout with Flexbox to ensure proper alignment across devices.

🔹 Key Concepts Demonstrated

RESTful API development and integration
Asynchronous programming using Axios and Promises
Frontend-backend communication over HTTP
State management using React Hooks
Dynamic and responsive UI design

🔹 Conclus

The project provides a hands-on understanding of full-stack development, covering both server-side and client-side workflows.
It showcases how data is created on the backend, transmitted securely via an API, and dynamically rendered on the frontend.
Serves as a strong foundation for scaling into advanced web applications with CRUD operations, databases, and authentication systems.
