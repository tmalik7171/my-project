This code creates a clean and simple banking interface using just HTML and CSS. 
It shows your balance starting at "$0" and has two buttons—Deposit and Withdraw—to simulate basic banking actions. 
The layout is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, meaning it looks good on both desktop and mobile. 
Everything sits neatly in the center of the screen using the Flexbox. 
The white card in the middle has soft rounded corners and a light shadow to give it a modern touch. 
The Deposit button is green, and the Withdraw button is red, making their purpose easy to understand at a glance.
